# BLE-Android

BLE githubParisa is a module for Ble to connect to your Thermometer or any other BLE devices and send data to your mobile App.
there is also a second class that belongs to a sample BLE device(Thermometer) that has a unic UUID.
its just for you to see how i implemented this class.
you can use ThermometerClassKotlin for your own App.just need to change the UUIDs.
tnx
